            Minecraft also lets you play with friends in multiplayer mode, where you can build huge cities together or go on epic adventures. You can mine resources like wood, stone, and diamonds to craft tools and weapons. There are also different game modes, like **Creative** where you can build without limits, and **Survival**, where you must gather resources to stay alive and fight off enemies like zombies, skeletons, and creepers. The game has endless possibilities, so you can create anything from castles to entire roller coasters. It's a great way to improve problem-solving and teamwork skills!

          <div class="video-games__valorant-text">
            Valorant is a team-based tactical shooter where you play as an **Agent**, each with unique abilities. In 5v5 matches, one team tries to plant a bomb (the **Spike**), while the other defends. You earn money each round to buy weapons and abilities, making smart decisions important. 

            Teamwork and strategy are key, as you combine gunplay with your Agent's abilities to outsmart opponents. Whether you're planting the Spike or defusing it, every move matters. Valorant is a great game to play with friends, sharpening both your aim and teamwork skills!</div>
